# EERI — versions

## v6 — 2026-08-13 — the reconciliation, and Eeri is animated

**Two lineages had diverged with no common ancestor and both held real work.**
This branch forked at v2 and went down the art-pipeline path (a Meshy driver,
a mesh slicer, docs); the deployed site went to v5 with multi-room sites, a
camera director, background events, the `paint` map and a 98-check gate.
Deploying either over the other would have deleted the other's work.

**The site's tree is the base.** Every one of its gameplay advances is kept
untouched — `camera.js`, `layers.js` with `backgroundEvents`, `level.js` with
`SITES`, `pieces.js`, `main.js`, the paint map, the size-checked seam. What
came across from the branch is only what is additive:

- **Eeri is a Meshy-rigged, animated character, and he is live.** The owner's
  kid from their own photograph — olive dinosaur cap, navy dino tee,
  machine-yellow wellies — T-posed, meshed, auto-rigged and carrying five
  animator-authored clips: idle, walk, run, jump and sit. He replaces the
  hard-hat-and-vest placeholder, which was the character before the owner gave
  the reference.
- **The seam learned a second kind of rig.** A hand-cut model declares the
  `nodes` the game rotates; a skinned character declares the named `clips` it
  can play. `rig: "skinned"` picks which contract is checked. It composes with
  the site's own `paint` map rather than replacing it, and an unpainted
  skinned model still gets the house material language applied, because §3.2
  is the rule either way.
- **The seam normalises HEIGHT.** A generated model has no idea what a tile
  is: Meshy rigs to real-world metres, so Eeri arrived 0.95 units tall in a
  world where he is 1.62 and stood in the level looking like a background
  figure. `height` in the manifest is in TILES and the seam rescales on load.
- `ClipDriver` in `kid.js` maps the game's five states onto clips and
  **crossfades** between them (0.15 s — the clips are separate takes and a
  hard cut pops), and scales the run's playback by actual speed. The rig is
  modelled facing +Z, which is Meshy's requirement, so it carries a −90° yaw.

The palette keeps `VEST` and `SHIRT`: the hard-hat kid is gone but
`layers.js` still paints its traffic cones with `VEST`, and dropping the key
would have taken the cones out of the near lane.

**A live bug was found on the way in: the 2D layer art was shipped and
never requested.** `layers.js` imported `assets.js?v=1` while `main.js`
imported `?v=2` — two tokens for one module, so the browser instantiated it
twice. `manifest` is module-level state in there, so `loadManifest()` ran on
one instance and `getLayerTexture()` asked the other, whose manifest was
still `null`. Every layer silently fell back to its code-painted placeholder
while 2.7 MB of painted PNG sat in `assets/2d/` unrequested. All three
changed modules are renumbered and every importer updated, which is the whole
reason the repo's one-token-per-module rule exists.

**The gate was stale and is fixed rather than excused.** Its last two checks
asserted that walking out of the room sets `cleared` — the single-room ending
that v3 replaced with site progression. They now assert the site index moves
and the next room is built, which is what the game does. 49 checks passing.

**Honest caveat for whoever picks this up:** the site's own 98-check gate
lives on its working branch, which `gh-pages` does not carry (it ships no
`test/`). **That gate is the authoritative one** — run it before the next
deploy. The 49 here are this branch's and are narrower.

The art pipeline that produced Eeri is documented at repo root in
**`ART_PIPELINE.md`** (concept → mesh → rig → animate → integrate, costs, and
a trap index) and the quality target in **`ART_TARGET.md`** — which nails the
mix at **~80% stylised 2D environment, ~20% 3D**, and audits against BOTH
halves of the confirmed reference pair rather than just Tropical Freeze.
`art-src/craft/` holds four crafted-cardboard layer concepts in the Crafted
World register, with the style block that produced them.

## v5 — 2026-08-13
**The art lands, and the game goes up on the floor.** The seam built in
v1 did its job: five layer paintings and the excavator swapped from code
placeholder to file with a status flip, and no game code changed to
accept them. The excavator GLB honours the rig contract exactly — every
contracted node present, and its rest pose, pivots and node translations
match the placeholder to three decimals, so `house.y = 0.86`, the 0.52
boom and the −1.35 stick all land where the code already reached for
them. Its `wheels` node ships without the child spinners the placeholder
had, so the wheels do not roll; everything else animates.

**Two house rules had to be enforced at the seam rather than assumed.**
The model arrived with five baked photo-texture materials at metallic
0.5 — and §3.2 makes "one palette, one material language" a make-or-break
rule, not a preference, precisely because the risk in a 2D/3D game is the
cast and the world reading as two different games. It rendered rust-brown
against a brown hoarding and stopped being safety yellow. So a model
entry may now carry a `paint` map (node → palette role) and `assets.js`
replaces its materials with flat palette colours, keeping every bit of
geometry and rig. The node contract was already enforced there; the
surface is now too. Omit `paint` to ship an asset's own materials.

The fore painting was composed against the **old** occluder rect
(y −1…5), which v4 corrected to −2…14 so a foreground can actually be
cropped by the top of the frame. `art-src/tools/recanvas-fore.mjs` moves
it onto the taller canvas **at the exact world position it was painted
for** — the same pixels, the same world units, simply with room above
them. Its sibling tool pinned an absolute path into a scratch directory
and stopped working when that session ended; this one resolves playwright
through CJS instead, since ESM does not honour `NODE_PATH`.

**Deployed.** The cabinet was lit on the hub and pointed at `eeri/`,
which did not exist on `gh-pages` — Play was a 404. The game, the
catalogue entry and the `worksite` marquee are on the site now, merged
into the site's own `games.js`/`art.js` rather than overwriting them
(the site carries `tokotrip`, which this branch does not, and an
overwrite deletes a cabinet). `deploy-hub.mjs` renumbered every token
from one map, and its guard caught that the site's `hub.js` had grown a
WebXR floor sort this branch never had — brought back before deploying,
or the deploy would have deleted it.

**The textures the model never showed are gone.** Every one of its five
textured materials is covered by the paint map, so those images were
bytes the browser downloaded, decoded into blob URLs and threw away —
and each was an async load still in flight when the hub gate opened the
game and moved on, which is how they were found: a `Couldn't load
texture blob:` error that only Eeri produced.
`art-src/tools/strip-textures.mjs` removes them and compacts the buffer;
it refuses to run if any textured material is NOT repainted, since then
stripping would change what is on screen. Geometry, tri count, node
names, rest pose and pivots are untouched, and the frame is
pixel-identical. 924 → 851 KB.

Known, and the asset producer's call: at 851 KB and 8 740 triangles the
excavator is over the brief's ceilings (400 KB, and 3 000 tris for a
small machine / 6 000 for a big set-piece) — the weight is geometry, not
textures, so it wants decimating rather than re-exporting. Its `wheels`
node has no child spinners, so the wheels do not roll. And the fore
painting still sits below the playfield ground line, so it reads as a
band along the bottom rather than something you pass behind.

Gate: 98 checks, plus 13 against the deployed tree.

## v4 — 2026-08-13
**The depth pass — the Tropical Freeze half, which needs no cast.** The
3D characters are blocked on the Meshy pipeline, so this version moves
the other half of the confirmed reference pair: "2D gameplay, fully 3D
layered world — dramatic depth, the camera drifting on rails, background
layers where things happen, heavy-object weight." None of that needs a
model. It was judged the way the method says — render, LOOK, name what is
wrong, redo — and the LOOK named three things:

**A third of every frame was dead flat brown.** The earth below the lip
was one unbroken slab: the largest area on screen carrying no
information, which is the one thing the reference never does. It is a
cut section now — strata darkening downward, cobbles embedded in the
face, a fresh cut edge drawn either side of every hole, and a hard
shadow under the grass lip, because the lane the game is played on was a
0.14-tile hairline against a flat wall. The bank bands the same way; it
is the room's most important object and it read as a box.

**The occluder lane was buried.** Its rect stopped at y=5 — one tile
above the ground line — so a foreground piece physically could not reach
the top of the frame, and the one girder in it floated inside the dirt.
The "cropped foreground = depth" lesson was written in the brief and
absent from the screen. The rect runs −2…14 now, the whole visible band
at that depth, and carries a real kit: scaffold standards you pass
behind, spoil sweeping the bottom edge, a pipe run crossing above
everything. Two things it got wrong first and the README now states: a
big shape parked at eye level is a blob with the game hidden behind it
(the cable drums were 1.25-unit discs at head height), and a heap whose
crest sits below the playfield's ground line reads as a hole cut in the
earth rather than a mound in front of it.

**The background competed instead of receding.** A haze band sits the far
stack in air, and the skyline lost its internal contrast — crisp two-tone
blocks at that distance read as near and fought the playfield.

Plus the two things the reference has that a spring does not.
**`js/camera.js` is a director**: a site declares SHOTS — zones with
their own dolly, height and lead — and the camera blends across them, so
a room pulls back where it is asking you to read a lock and closes in
where it is not. Over that sit a slow **drift**, so the frame is never
dead still, and a **punch** — a short dolly kick on the dig, the sling,
the span seating and every hit, which is what weight looks like from
behind a camera. And **the background works**: a crane traverses a load
across the skyline and a truck crosses the far road, where before one
digging machine was one event in ninety-six tiles.

**The seam, hardened, because asset input has started.** Art contributes
files to `assets/` and a status flip, nothing else — so the gate now
refuses a manifest path that climbs out of that folder, and measures a
live PNG's pixels against its documented size rather than letting it
stretch silently onto the plane. The size table in `assets/README.md` is
the brief an artist paints to, so it is checked against `LAYER_RECTS` ×
`PPU` in code rather than trusted to have been kept up by hand. Both
guards were verified by feeding the gate bad input and watching it fail.

Gate: 93 checks.

## v3 — 2026-08-13
**The level beyond one room.** Walking through the gate now leads
somewhere: sites are data (`SITES` in `js/level.js` — map, bolts, spawns,
exit, and which lock the room carries), one `buildSite()` builds a room
into a single group and tears the old one down whole, the kid and the
machine persist, and the camera **cuts** to the new room — a slow pan
across a rebuilt world is a lie about geography. Each room's machine
starts unmanned again: taming does not carry between sites, so the mount
is read every time, which is the point of it.

Site 2 is **the girder** — the second manipulable piece, its contract
already waiting in the manifest: stacked → slung → seated as a span. The
gap is eight tiles, past *both* of them — the kid's jump falls short and
the machine refuses the cliff. The same gesture as the dig works it the
other way round: hold the bucket in the stack and the chains take the
load (the machine drives at ×0.55 while carrying — a machine earns its
slowness); lower it at the lip and the span seats, filling the MAP row
the way the dig cleared one, so the bridged gap is a fact about the
level. The kid crosses on foot, because the exit is his half of the job.

Found by LOOKING, not by the gate: a slung load hung a fixed length
under the bucket and **sank into the ground** when the boom came down —
now the chains go slack and the load rests, never sinks (the rest depth
is measured off the asset's own bounding box, so a live GLB keeps the
behaviour). Found the flaky way: the GPU-less sandbox runs the clock
~5× slow, so a mount that takes 0.55 s of game time takes ~3 s of wall
clock — the test's retry loop now walks back up and gives each attempt
real time, and the crossing is asserted mid-span instead of demanding a
36-tile walk inside a wall-clock timeout.

Gate: 65 checks.

## v2 — 2026-08-13
**The loop.** v1 had systems and no game: riding was strictly worse than
walking (45% slower, no jump, a five-times wider body), the boom was a
verb with no object, and the room had no reason to go right. v2 is the
answer, and it is the owner's: **a machine is dangerous until it is
yours, and the room is a lock the machine opens.**

The excavator now starts **unmanned** — amber beacon turning, working its
own slow dig cycle. It is not hunting Eeri; it is heavy and blind, and
standing under the bucket while it sweeps puts him down. The lift is the
window, so **mounting is the skill test**: read the cycle, take the step,
and the beacon goes out — the threat is now the tool, permanently.

The room is two obstacles, each shaped for exactly one of them. **The
pit** is kid-shaped: he clears it in a run, and the machine refuses a
cliff. **The bank** is machine-shaped: three tiles of dirt above his
jump, taken down a row at a time by holding the bucket in it. Digging
edits the **map**, not the picture, so the level really changed; the
bank's cut face and spill are drawn per state (`js/pieces.js`, behind the
same asset seam as everything else, contract `state0/1/2`). Walking out
through the gate the machine opened is SITE CLEAR.

Fixed on the way: a queued `action` press was consumed again the instant
riding began, so a player who mashed E climbed in and fell straight back
out — the same double-consume trap Suds Jack paid for, now drained at
both edges. The HUD moved to the top-right; it had been sitting under
`hub/shell.js`'s HOME button, unreadable, in every screenshot.

Gate: 49 checks.

## v1 — 2026-08-12
Gate-1 diorama slice, asset-ready. The full layer stack (sky / skyline /
far / mid / near / foreground occluders) as code-painted cutouts at real
z-depths behind a 24° long-lens camera; tile-grid level with collision
(ground, mounds, steel platforms, a pit, a girder); Eeri on foot (run /
buffered+coyote jump / hard-landing squash); the excavator as first mount
(E to climb in via the step, drive with heavy ease, W/S boom on real
hinges, hop out); 19 bolt spinners to collect; a depth-tinted background
excavator working a dig loop on the far layer; blob shadows, exhaust
puffs, touch buttons. **The asset seam is live:** `assets/manifest.json` +
`js/assets.js` — every model and 2D layer swaps from code placeholder to
PNG/GLB file with a one-word manifest edit against the node contracts in
`assets/README.md`.

The first hazard is in and it sets the pattern: a wrecking ball hangs dead
still until you come near, then **winds back** — chevrons pulsing, one
warning tone — and only then swings. Nothing here kills; the cost is the
**Yoshi rule**, a hit takes the RIDE (thrown clear of the cab) and never
the run, with mercy frames on foot. A synth kit carries it, including a
diesel bed whose pitch rises with the machine's load, and the arcade
cabinet (`worksite` cover), the way home and the Toko signature are
mounted. `prefers-reduced-motion` stills the decorative background
machine and holds the chevrons steady instead of flashing.

Not yet: more machines, more world themes, the level beyond one room.
