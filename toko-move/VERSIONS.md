# Toko Move — versions

## v2.7 — 2026-08-29

Full-network refresh pipeline. GitHub Actions can now fetch the official HSL GTFS feed, build the Helsinki tram + metro pack with zero geometric approximation tolerance, validate that the old central clipping box is gone, and open a data PR only when the source changes. The runtime now accepts both the old clipped pack and the future full-Helsinki pack without crashing, and the opening screen/hub are bumped to v2.7.

## v2.6 — 2026-08-29

Visible-build pass. The opening screen now shows a large, unmistakable `v2.6` build number so hub testers can immediately confirm which Toko Move revision is loaded. Hub metadata is bumped in lockstep. The exact HSL transit inspector from v2.5 remains the active map-development path.

## v2.5 — 2026-08-29

Exact transit inspector pass. The playable delivery build now exposes the committed HSL GTFS geometry through a dedicated MAP view instead of falsely overlaying it on the still-authored gameplay graph. Every source tram/metro line-direction is independently visible, hideable and soloable, with tram-only, metro-only and show-all controls. Geometry is rendered directly from the committed source paths with no octolinear redraw or hand-authored approximation. The source limitation remains explicit: the current exact pack is clipped to central Helsinki while the restored full-feed packer waits for a complete HSL GTFS ZIP. Also fixes the main module's quote escaping bug.

## v2.4 — 2026-08-29

Exact-transit foundation. Restores the repo's HSL city packs and GTFS tooling, adds one display layer per source line-direction, preserves each committed GTFS path object unchanged, and gates independent layer visibility. The authoritative rule is now explicit: Helsinki transit geometry must come from source data rather than approximated route drawing.

## v2.3 — 2026-08-29

Cargo behaviour and visual identity pass. Cargo types now alter routing or scoring: hot/fresh food rewards fast delivery, fragile cargo is constrained to tram routing and earns a safe direct-run bonus, equipment stays on transit, market goods use tram routes, and express work pays a speed bonus. The UI gains cargo badges, a live deadline meter, stronger Helsinki typography, coloured destination markers, and a light harbour/city overlay on the map.

## v2.2 — 2026-08-29

Delivery depth pass. The ten Central Helsinki jobs now have cargo types, per-job deadlines and score values; late deliveries still count but pay half score. Three later jobs become multi-stop A → B → C runs, and the first express job triggers an 08:00 rush-hour passenger wave that competes for the same network capacity. HUD and job sheet now show the current leg, deadline and score.

## v2.1 — 2026-08-29

Reliability and geography pass for the Central Helsinki delivery game. The startup copy and HUD now describe the delivery objective, the main module cache token is bumped, and the daylight smoke gate tests the Helsinki graph instead of the old Kallio route. The board expands south and east with Ruoholahti, Senaatintori and Katajanokka, and the ten-job route now crosses those areas.

## v2 — 2026-08-29

Central Helsinki becomes the authored game board. The primary objective is now a chain of ten concrete A → B courier jobs across Pasila, Töölö, Kallio, Sörnäinen, Kalasatama, Hakaniemi, Kamppi, Rautatientori and Kauppatori. Existing metro, tram and rail services form the transport skeleton; player-drawn lines solve the gaps.

## v1 — 2026-08-18

The day half joins the hub: the same flow-core city as Piritori — provably, by
seed — moving people to school and work in daylight. No product, no heat, no
fights; the goals panel and the clean transit read are the whole game.
